This repository makes part of the supplementary material of a pedagogic paper entitled "Adiabatic quantum computation: From The adiabatic Theorem to D-Wave quantum computer"

Here the reader will find a jupyter-notebook concerning the implementation of the travelling salesman problem on the D-Wave through the Amazon Braket platform. 
Also, we present the codes we used to solve the Grover algorithm by using the qutip library and the codes to plot the D-Wave topologies.
